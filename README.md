# ARQ Simulation Program (Group 7)
This is a Jupyter Notebook program that can simulate and calculate three Automatic Repeat Request Protocol (ARQ) methods:
- Stop-and-Wait,
- Go-Back-N, and
- Selective Repeat.
The program was created by Group 7 (Adiva Veronia, Joshevan, and Miranty Anjani Putri) for Mid-Term Project of Wireless Technology.

## Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 and Anaconda installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Anaconda from the official website: [Anaconda] (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

Aside from that, you need to install the Matplotlib and Numpy. You can install the two libraries from their official website: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/).

Once you have both Python 3 and Anaconda installed, you can download the program from the GitHub repository: [Github](https://github.com/MirantyAnjaniPutri/ARQ-Simulator)

## Running the Program
You can also run the program through Google Colaboratory through [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Nq1HKzueaZKL4WckG6P69ZpZwMd-YtJI?usp=sharing)

or

To run the program, open File Explorer and navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then, open the program with Visual Studio Code.

```
Run cell
Enter the value as asked by the program
Display the graph output of the ARQ
```

The complete guide can be found in [here](https://github.com/MirantyAnjaniPutri/ARQ-Simulator/blob/c031f8cd5836793d5a83382070319f43f0476091/ARQ%20Simulation%20Guide%20and%20Graph%20Output_Group%207.pdf)

## ARQ Methods
The program can simulate three ARQ methods:

```
Stop-and-Wait
Go-Back-N
Selective Repeat
```
User can set the parameters for the simulation, such as the packet length in bits, the data rate of the channel in bit/s and the round trip delay in seconds.
